### 重要事项

On firmwares 1.0.0 - 2.3.0, the Homebrew Launcher is currently "installed" to your device through a script ran through [PegaSwitch](https://github.com/ReSwitched/PegaSwitch). 

This will allow you to access the Homebrew Launcher through the Album application *until your device is rebooted*, after which you must *rerun the script* to restore Homebrew Launcher functionality. 

After a reboot, you will have to re-run this secondary exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device. Additionally, note that this secondary exploit will also prevent you from playing retail games for as long as it remains active (*until your device is rebooted*).
 
If you are familiar with iOS device "jailbreaking", this idea could be considered analagous to a "tethered jailbreak".

Note that, while these instructions also work on firmware version 3.0.0, it would be far easier to instead follow [Homebrew Launcher (Installer)](homebrew-launcher-(installer)) for that firmware version.

### 操作步骤

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Power off your device
1. 将 SD 卡插入电脑
1. Copy `hbmenu.nro` from the nx-hbmenu `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `hbl.nsp` to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `switch` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist

#### Section II - PegaSwitch Configuration

1. After downloading the latest version of PegaSwitch, copy `nsp.js` to `PegaSwitch/usefulscripts`
1. Start CMD / Terminal and `cd` to the PegaSwitch folder
1. Run `npm install`; this will install the node modules that PegaSwitch depends on
1. Start PegaSwitch by running the command corresponding to your operating system
  + **Linux/macOS:** Run `sudo node start.js` and make note of the IP address it displays
  + **Windows:** Run `node start.js` and make note of the IP address it displays
1. Exit PegaSwitch by inputting Ctrl+C twice

#### Section III - DNS Configuration

Note that these DNS servers will need to be set on each network you connect your device to in order for it to be able to trigger the exploit.
{: .notice--info}

1. 启动系统设置
1. 进入到 `互联网(Internet)` -> `互联网设置(Internet Settings)`
1. 选择你当前的网络
  + 已连接的网络旁边会有绿色的标记

  + This is usually in the format of `192.168.1.XXX`
1. 保存网络设置
1. 退出系统设置

#### Section IV - Initial Installation

Note that you will have to re-run this section of the exploit after each reboot in order to re-enable access to the Homebrew Launcher.

##### Option i - Firmware Version 1.0.0

Note that this option only applies devices with firmware version 1.0.0; if you have firmware versions 2.0.0 - 2.3.0, scroll down to "Option ii - Firmware Versions 2.0.0 - 2.3.0".

Note that firmware 1.0.0 currently requires a Japanese copy of Puyo Puyo Tetris S in order to connect to PegaSwitch for the first time. After that, an alternative method of connecting to PegaSwitch will become available.
{: .notice--info}

1. Ensure your firewall does not block incoming connections to UDP port 53 or TCP ports 80 and 8100
1. Launch PegaSwitch in your command/terminal prompt by typing `sudo node start.js --webapplet`
1. Launch Puyo Puyo Tetris S on your device
1. Press A and then press R
1. Press A and touch the bottom-most menu item labelled "お問い合わせ先"
1. Touch the SEGA logo in the bottom-left corner; this will launch the webapplet and load the PegaSwitch webpage.
1. PegaSwitch on your PC should show that your device has connected and show its firmware version and MAC address in the prompt.
1. In PegaSwitch on your computer, type `evalfile usefulscripts/nsp.js`
1. Press the Home button to exit
1. Launch the Album applet
1. If the exploit was successful, the Homebrew Launcher will launch

##### Option ii - Firmware Versions 2.0.0 - 2.3.0

Note that this option only applies devices with firmware versions 2.0.0 - 2.3.0; if you have firmware version 1.0.0, scroll up to "Option i - Firmware Versions 1.0.0".

1. Launch PegaSwitch in your command/terminal prompt by typing `sudo node start.js` 
1. 进入到 `互联网(Internet)` -> `互联网设置(Internet Settings)`
1. 选择你当前的网络
1. Select "Connect to this Network"
1. If the DNS connection was successful, you will see the message "Registration is required to use this network."
1. Select "Next"
1. The PegaSwitch webpage will load
1. PegaSwitch on your PC should show that your device has connected and show its firmware version and MAC address in the prompt.
1. Run `evalfile usefulscripts/nsp.js`
1. Press the Home button to exit
1. Launch the Album applet
1. If the exploit was successful, the Homebrew Launcher will launch 

#### Section V - Fake News (Optional)

As you must re-run the "Initial Installation" section of the exploit after each reboot, it would be ideal if there was a more convenient way of connecting to PegaSwitch.

Fortunately, we can install a fake entry into the News applet (the "Fake News" exploit) which can make connecting to PegaSwitch significantly easier.

Note that modifying system save data can **brick** your device permanently if you are not careful! It is highly recommended to avoid editing the `installFakeNews.js` script to avoid damaging your device.
{: .notice--warning}

1. In order to do so, connect your device to PegaSwitch as in Section III
1. Once connected to PegaSwitch, run `evalfile usefulscripts/installFakeNews.js` and wait for it to finish
1. Reboot your device and you should see a PegaSwitch news entry
1. To trigger Fake News, start PegaSwitch on your PC with `sudo node start.js --webapplet` and then select the Fake News entry on your device and tap to open the "video"

Note that, currently, homebrew development is in a very early state with a very limited number of applications.

You can find available applications on [switchbrew](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_Applications), [/r/SwitchHacks on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchHacks/), or [Switch Homebrew on GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/forums/285/).

To install homebrew applications, simply copy the homebrew `.nro` file to the `/switch/` folder on your SD card.

___

You can now launch the Homebrew Launcher by launching the Album application from your device's home menu (*until your device is rebooted*).
{: .notice--success}

You will now be unable to launch retail cartridge or eShop games (*until your device is rebooted*).
{: .notice--warning}

You will need to re-run `evalfile usefulscripts/nsp.js` with PegaSwitch (using any browser applet) after each reboot in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device.
