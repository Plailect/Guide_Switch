### Required Reading

Currently, homebrew is only available for firmware version 3.0.0, but future homebrew and CFW support is planned for all versions up to 4.1.0.

In order to guarantee future access, we set your current network's DNS to a server (hosted by ReSwitched) which blocks requests to Nintendo's Switch update server.

If you are on firmware version 4.1.0, this will allow you to continue to use online services (without worrying about being updated) for as long as 4.1.0 is the latest version.

Note that, to access online services on 4.1.0, you will need to have connected to online services at least once before following these instructions.

Additionally, we enter Recovery / Maintenance Mode and delete any update data which may have already been downloaded.

### Instructions

#### Section I - DNS Configuration

Note that these DNS servers will need to be set on each network you connect your device to for it to block updates!
