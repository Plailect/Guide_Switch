### Required Reading

On firmwares 1.0.0 - 2.3.0, the Homebrew Launcher is currently "installed" to your device through a script ran through [PegaSwitch](https://github.com/ReSwitched/PegaSwitch). 

This will allow you to access the Homebrew Launcher through the Album application *until your device is rebooted*, after which you must *rerun the script* to restore Homebrew Launcher functionality. 

After a reboot, you will have to re-run this secondary exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device. Additionally, note that this secondary exploit will also prevent you from playing retail games for as long as it remains active (*until your device is rebooted*).
 
If you are familiar with iOS device "jailbreaking", this idea could be considered analagous to a "tethered jailbreak".

Note that while these instructions also work for firmware 3.0.0, it is substantially less tedious to follow <a href="homebrew-launcher">Homebrew Launcher (Installer)</a> instead for that firmware.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Power off your device
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy `hbmenu.nro` from the nx-hbmenu `.zip` to the root of your SD card

1. After downloading the latest version of PegaSwitch, copy `nsp.js` to `PegaSwitch/usefulscripts`
1. Start cmd/terminal and `cd` to the PegaSwitch folder
1. Run `npm install`; this will install the node modules that PegaSwitch depends on
1.  
  + **Linux/macOS:** Run `sudo node start.js` and make note of the IP address it shows
  + **Windows:** Run `node start.js` and make note of the IP address it shows
1. Exit PegaSwitch by typing Ctrl+C twice.

#### Section III - DNS Configuration

Note that these DNS servers will need to be set on each network you connect your device to in order for it to be able to trigger the exploit.
{: .notice--info}

{: .notice--info}

Note that firmware 1.0.0 (initially) requires a Japanese copy of Puyo Puyo Tetris S to launch PegaSwitch.
{: .notice--info}

1. Launch PegaSwitch in your command/terminal prompt by typing `sudo node start.js --webapplet`. If on Windows, you may need to temporarily disable Windows Firewall in order for the Switch to connect.
1. Launch Puyo Puyo Tetris S
1. Press A and then press R
1. Press A and touch the bottom-most menu item labelled "お問い合わせ先"
1. Touch the SEGA logo in the bottom-left corner; this will launch the webapplet and load the PegaSwitch webpage.
1. PegaSwitch on your PC should show that your Switch has connected and show its firmware version and MAC address in the prompt.
1. In PegaSwitch on your computer, type `evalfile usefulscripts/nsp.js`
1. Press the Home button to exit
1. Launch the Album applet
1. If the exploit was successful, the Homebrew Launcher will launch 
1. **You will need to repeat these steps every time you reboot your Switch.**

#### Section III - Initial Installation (Firmware 2.0.0 - 2.3.0)
1. Launch PegaSwitch in your command/terminal prompt by typing `sudo node start.js` 
1. Navigate to `Internet` -> `Internet Settings`

1. Select "Connect to this Network"
1. If the DNS connection was successful, you will see the message "Registration is required to use this network."
1. Select "Next"
1. The PegaSwitch webpage will load
1. PegaSwitch on your PC should show that your Switch has connected and show its firmware version and MAC address in the prompt.
1. Run `evalfile usefulscripts/nsp.js`
1. Press the Home button to exit
1. Launch the Album applet
1. If the exploit was successful, the Homebrew Launcher will launch

#### Section V - Fake News (Optional)

Modifying System save data can **brick** your Switch permanently! It is highly recommended to avoid editing `installFakeNews.js` in any way.
{: .notice--warning}


1. As launching PegaSwitch can be somewhat tedious, particularly on firmware 1.0, we can install "Fake News" to make it slightly less annoying. This will install a fake entry to the News applet that can launch PegaSwitch
1. In order to do so, connec your Switch to PegaSwitch as in Section III
1. Once connected to PegaSwitch, run `evalfile usefulscripts/installFakeNews.js` and wait for it to finish
1. Reboot your device and you should see a PegaSwitch news entry
1. To trigger Fake News, start PegaSwitch on your PC with `sudo node start.js --webapplet` and then select the Fake News entry on the Switch and tap to open the "video"

Note that, currently, homebrew development is in a very early state with a very limited number of applications.

You can find available applications on [switchbrew](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_Applications), [/r/SwitchHacks on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchHacks/), or [Switch Homebrew on GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/forums/285/).

To install homebrew applications, simply copy the homebrew `.nro` file to the `/switch/` folder on your SD card.

___

You can now launch the Homebrew Launcher by launching the Album application from your device's home menu (*until your device is rebooted*).
{: .notice--success}

You will now be unable to launch retail cartridge or eShop games (*until your device is rebooted*).
{: .notice--warning}

You will need to re-run `evalfile usefulscripts/nsp.js` with PegaSwitch (using any browser applet) after each reboot in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device.
