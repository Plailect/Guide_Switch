### Required Reading

Currently, homebrew is only available for firmware version 3.0.0, but future homebrew and CFW support is planned for all versions up to 4.1.0 (with support for 5.0.0 to be determined).

In order to guarantee future access, we set your current network's DNS to a server (hosted by ReSwitched) which blocks requests to Nintendo's Switch update server.

If you are on firmware version 5.0.0 and wish to continue to use online services with updates blocked, you can do so for as long as 5.0.0 is the latest version (as only the latest firmware version is permitted to access online services). For this to work, the only requirement is that you must have connected to online services at least once before following these instructions.

Additionally, we enter Recovery / Maintenance Mode and delete any update data which may have already been downloaded.

### Instructions

Note that these DNS servers will need to be set on each network you connect your device to for it to block updates!
