### Required Readin'

Currently, homebrew is only available for firmware version 3.0.0, but future homebrew and CFW support is planned for all versions up to 4.1.0 (with support for 5.0.0 to be determined).

In order to guarantee future access, we gunna be settin' ye current network's DNS to a certain server (hosted by ReSwitched) that blocks requests to Nintendo's update server fer th' Switch.

If you are on firmware version 5.0.0 and wish to continue to use online services with updates blocked, you can do so for as long as 5.0.0 is the latest version (as only the latest firmware version is permitted to access online services). For this to work, the only requirement is that you must have connected to online services at least once before following these instructions.

Additionally, we gunna be enterin' Recovery / Maintenance Mode 'n deletin' any update data which may have already been downloaded.
