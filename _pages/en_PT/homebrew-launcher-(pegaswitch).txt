### Required Readin'

On firmwares 1.0.0 - 2.3.0, th' Homebrew Launcher currently be "installed" to ye device usin' a script ran through [PegaSwitch](https://github.com/ReSwitched/PegaSwitch). 

'Tis gunna be allowin' ye to access th' Homebrew Launcher through th' Album application, *but only 'til ye device be rebooted.* After it be rebooted, ye gotta be *rerunnin' th' script* to restore Homebrew Launcher functionality. 

After a reboot, ye gunna need to be re-runnin' 'tis secondary exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on ye device. Additionally, note that 'tis secondary exploit gunna also prevent ye from playin' retail games fer as long as it remains active (meanin' *'til ye device be rebooted*).
 
If ye be familiar wit' iOS devices' "jailbreaking", 'tis idea could be thought analogous to a "tethered jailbreak".

Note that although these instructions work fine on firmware version 3.0.0, it be far easier instead fer 3.0.0 users to be followin' [Homebrew Launcher (Installer)](homebrew-launcher-(installer)).

#### Section V - Fake News (Optional)

As you must re-run the "Initial Installation" section of the exploit after each reboot, it would be ideal if there was a more convenient way of connecting to PegaSwitch.

Fortunately, we can install a fake entry into the News applet (the "Fake News" exploit) which can make connecting to PegaSwitch significantly easier.

Note that modifying system save data can **brick** your device permanently if you are not careful! It is highly recommended to avoid editing the `installFakeNews.js` script to avoid damaging your device.
