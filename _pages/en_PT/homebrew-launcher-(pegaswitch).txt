### Required Readin'

On firmwares 1.0.0 - 2.3.0, the Homebrew Launcher is currently "installed" to your device through a script ran through [PegaSwitch](https://github.com/ReSwitched/PegaSwitch). 

This will allow you to access the Homebrew Launcher through the Album application *until your device is rebooted*, after which you must *rerun the script* to restore Homebrew Launcher functionality. 

After a reboot, ye gunna need to be re-runnin' 'tis secondary exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on ye device. Additionally, note that 'tis secondary exploit gunna also prevent ye from playin' retail games fer as long as it remains active (meanin' *'til ye device be rebooted*).
 
If you are familiar with iOS device "jailbreaking", this idea could be considered analagous to a "tethered jailbreak".

Note that, while these instructions also work on firmware version 3.0.0, it would be far easier to instead follow [Homebrew Launcher (Installer)](homebrew-launcher-(installer)) for that firmware version.

#### Section V - Fake News (Optional)

As you must re-run the "Initial Installation" section of the exploit after each reboot, it would be ideal if there was a more convenient way of connecting to PegaSwitch.

Fortunately, we can install a fake entry into the News applet (the "Fake News" exploit) which can make connecting to PegaSwitch significantly easier.

Note that modifying system save data can **brick** your device permanently if you are not careful! It is highly recommended to avoid editing the `installFakeNews.js` script to avoid damaging your device.
{: .notice--warning}

1. In order to do so, connect your device to PegaSwitch as in Section III
1. Once connected to PegaSwitch, run `evalfile usefulscripts/installFakeNews.js` and wait for it to finish
1. Reboot your device and you should see a PegaSwitch news entry
1. To trigger Fake News, start PegaSwitch on your PC with `sudo node start.js --webapplet` and then select the Fake News entry on your device and tap to open the "video"
