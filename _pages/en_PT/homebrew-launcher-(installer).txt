After th' initial installation process be completed, a secondary exploit must be run afterward which gunna be allowin' ye access to th' Homebrew Launcher through th' Album application. 'Tis be lastin' *'til ye device be rebooted*. 

After a reboot, ye gunna need to be re-runnin' 'tis secondary exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on ye device. Additionally, note that 'tis secondary exploit gunna also prevent ye from playin' retail games fer as long as it remains active (meanin' *'til ye device be rebooted*).
 
If ye be familiar wit' "jailbreaks" fer iOS devices, 'tis idea could be thought analogous to a "semi-untethered jailbreak".

Note that th' current homebrew exploit has th' side-effect 'o corruptin' ye device's Mii Database upon initial installation. While 'tis effect be mostly harmless, any user-created Miis gunna be lost.

#### Section V - Alternative Browser Applets (Optional)

As you must re-run the "Run" section of the exploit after each reboot, it would be ideal if there was a more convenient way of launching the browser than the connection test.

Fortunately, there are actually [multiple](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Internet_Browser#Browser_Applets) browser applets on the Switch, and any of them can be used to trigger the browser exploit.

Two convenient methods for launching a browser are listed below:

##### eShop Sign In Prompt

To use this method, create a second account on your device. Do not connect it to a Nintendo Account.

1. Launch Nintendo eShop
1. Select the second account
1. Select "Sign In and link"
1. The browser applet will launch

##### Game Update Prompt

To use this method, you must have at least one game on your home screen.

Note that, if you were not connected to the correct DNS servers, this method would *update* your device. It is dangerous!
{: .notice--danger}

1. Press (+) with any game highlighted
1. In the "Software Update" tab, select "Via the Internet"
1. The browser applet will launch

You can find available applications on [switchbrew](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_Applications), [/r/SwitchHacks on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchHacks/), or [Switch Homebrew on GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/forums/285/).
