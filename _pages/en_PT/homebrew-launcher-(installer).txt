{% include toc title="Page Treasure Map" %}

### Required Readin'

Th' Homebrew Launcher be "installed" to ye device as 'o late through a browser exploit. 

After th' initial installation process be completed, a secondary exploit must be run afterward which gunna be allowin' ye access to th' Homebrew Launcher through th' Album application. 'Tis be lastin' *'til ye device be rebooted*. 

After a reboot, ye gunna need to be re-runnin' 'tis secondary exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on ye device. Additionally, note that 'tis secondary exploit gunna also prevent ye from playin' retail games fer as long as it remains active (meanin' *'til ye device be rebooted*).
 
If ye be familiar wit' "jailbreaks" fer iOS devices, 'tis idea could be thought analogous to a "semi-untethered jailbreak".

Note that th' current homebrew exploit has th' side-effect 'o corruptin' ye device's Mii Database upon initial installation. While 'tis effect be mostly harmless, any user-created Miis gunna be lost.
