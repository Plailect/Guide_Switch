### Required Reading

The Homebrew Launcher is currently "installed" to your device through a browser exploit. 

Once the Homebrew Launcher has been installed and run, you will be able to access the Homebrew Launcher through the Album application *until your device is rebooted*.

Note that you will NOT be able to play retail games (cartridge or downloaded) after running the Homebrew Launcher. Rebooting your device will allow you to play retail games again.
{: .notice--warning}

After a reboot, you will have to re-run the exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device. If you are familiar with iOS device "jailbreaking", this idea could be considered analagous to a "semi-untethered jailbreak".

Note that the current homebrew exploit has the side-effect of corrupting your device's Mii Database upon initial installation. While this effect is harmless, it will result in the loss of any user-created Miis.

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device

#### Section II - DNS Configuration

Note that these DNS servers will need to be set on each network you connect your device to in order for it to be able to trigger the exploit.
{: .notice--info}

  + After the device reboots, there will be a message about the Mii database being corrupted. Press OK and the device will reboot again.

#### Section IV - Running the Homebrew Launcher

Note that you will have to re-run this section of the exploit after each reboot in order to re-enable access to the Homebrew Launcher.

1. Navigate to `Internet` -> `Test Connection`
1. Select your current network
1. Select "Connect to this Network"

1. Select "Run"
1. If the exploit was successful, you will receive a popup asking you to exit
1. Return to the home menu
1. Launch the Album application
1. If the exploit was successful, the Homebrew Launcher will launch

#### Section V - Alternative Browser Applets (Optional)

As you must re-run the "Run" section of the exploit after each reboot, it would be ideal if there was a more convenient way of launching the browser than the connection test.

Fortunately, there are actually [multiple](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Internet_Browser#Browser_Applets) browser applets on the Switch, and any of them can be used to trigger the browser exploit.

Two convenient methods for launching a browser are listed below:

##### eShop Sign In Prompt

To use this method, create a second account on your device. Do not connect it to a Nintendo Account.

1. Launch Nintendo eShop
1. Select the second account
1. Select "Sign In and link"
1. The browser applet will launch

##### Game Update Prompt

To use this method, you must have at least one game on your home screen.

Note that, if you were not connected to the correct DNS servers, this method would *update* your device. It is dangerous!
{: .notice--danger}

1. Press (+) with any game highlighted
1. In the "Software Update" tab, select "Via the Internet"
1. The browser applet will launch

Note that, currently, homebrew development is in a very early state with a very limited number of applications.

You can find available applications on [switchbrew](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_Applications), [/r/SwitchHacks on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchHacks/), or [Switch Homebrew on GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/forums/285/).

To install homebrew applications, simply copy the homebrew `.nro` file to the `/switch/` folder on your SD card.

___

You can now launch the Homebrew Launcher by launching the Album application from your device's home menu (until next reboot).
{: .notice--success}

You will need to re-run the "Run" step of the exploit (using any browser applet) after each reboot in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device.
